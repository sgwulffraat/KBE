Synopsis
--------

This repository contains all the source code libraries of ParaPy.

Example
-------

Here's an example::

    from parapy.core import *
    from parapy.geom import Box


    class MyPrimitive(Base):

        width = Input(required)
        length = Input(2.0)
        height = Input(derived)

        @Attribute
        def material(self):
            if self.height <= 1.0:
                return "aluminium"
            else:
                return "steel"

        @Part
        def shape(self):
            return Box(pass_down="width, lenght, height")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from parapy.gui import display
        obj = MyPrimitive()
        display(obj)

Motivation
----------

ParaPy is the first Knowledge-Based Engineering platform based on popular, 
widespread, easy-to-use technologies. The richness of its libraries, enables 
developers to rapidly develop and test applications that automate routine 
engineering work. ParaPy is particularly well-suited for automating otherwise 
manual CAD/CAE-related work, such as geometry modelling, grid generation and 
pre-processing of simulation models.
